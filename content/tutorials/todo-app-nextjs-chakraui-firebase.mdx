## Introduction

Building a TODO app is common practice when you are trying to learn a new stack. In this tutorial, I'll show you how to build a TODO app using Next.js, Chakra-UI, and Firebase.

## Bootstrapping With `next-firebase-auth`

I will be building this like any other project. This means, I will not be starting from scratch. Instead, we will be cloning the following repo which has Firebase Auth already implemented.

### .env

todo: list where to find all the environment variables

## Adding Chakra-UI

Once this is complete, we can add Chakra-UI to our project. First add the dependencies:

```bash
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4
```

## Writing Data to Firebase's Cloud Firestore
