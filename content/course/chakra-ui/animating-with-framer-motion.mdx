Framer motion is a library that makes it incredibly easy to animate anything! You might recall, in the [Getting Started](/courses/chakra-ui/getting-started-with-chakra-ui) module, we added framer motion when we installed Chakra UI. This is because Chakra UI relies on framer motion. This means, we can use it with no extra config! In this module, we'll take a look at some basic animations with framer motion.
