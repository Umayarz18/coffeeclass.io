In the [last module](/courses/chakra-ui/chakra-ui-default-theme), we took a look at Chakra UI's default theme. These styles work great, however you will most likely need to custimize some or all of them. We can do this by creating a custom theme, also known as overriding the default theme.

To begin, create a file named `theme.js`. Inside of this file, we will extend our default theme. To do this, we will use 2 Chakra UI imports.

```javascript:theme.js
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"
import { createBreakpoints } from "@chakra-ui/theme-tools"
```

`extendTheme` will allow us to pass our changes into the default theme and `createBreakpoints` will allow us to override the default breakpoints.

Add the following code beneth the imports.

```javascript:theme.js
const overrides = {
    
}

const customTheme = extendTheme(overrides)

export default customTheme
```

Above, we are creating a new object called `overrides` and passing it into our `extendTheme` function.

## Overriding Fonts

Let's start by overriding the default font. Declare a variable called `fonts` and set the `body` and `heading` fonts to whatever you'd like.

```javascript:theme.js
const fonts = {
    body: `Inter,"Segoe UI",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol"`,
    heading: `Inter,"Segoe UI",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol"`
}
```

In my case I am setting it to `Inter` - a google font and also passing in a bunch of fallbacks. Next, add this to our `overrides` object.

```javascript:theme.js
const overrides = {
    fonts, // <-- pass in the fonts object
}
```

Right now nothing will happen. This is because we aren't using this custom theme anywhere in our website! 

Recall in the [getting started](/courses/chakra-ui/getting-started-with-chakra-ui) section that we are using the `ChakraProvider` to render our app. This takes in a property called `theme` which is, you guessed it, our custom theme.

```javascript:_app.js
import customTheme from '../theme' // <-- import our custom theme

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={customTheme}> // <-- pass in our custom theme
        <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

You should now see your website font change!

## Overriding Breakpoints

Depending on your use case, you might want your own custom breakpoints. You can add them by using `createBreakpoints` and passing in a list of breakpoints.

```javascript:theme.js
const breakpoints = createBreakpoints({
    sm: '10em',
    md: '30em',
    lg: '40em',
    xl: '50em',
    "2xl": '55em',
    // and so on
})

const overrides = {
    fonts,
    breakpoints, // <-- pass in our breakpoints
}
```

> Pro Tip! Use `em` instead of `px` for font sizes.

## Overriding Configs

In the last module we added a dark mode switch. Chakra UI gives us some options to handle the starting color mode and use the users system preferences.

```javascript:theme.js
const config = {
    initialColorMode: "light",
    useSystemColorMode: false,
}

const overrides = {
    fonts,
    breakpoints,
    config, // <-- pass in our config
}
```

`initialColorMode` takes in `light` or `dark` and `useSystemColorMode` takes in `true` or `false`.

## Overriding Colors

In a lot of cases, you will have cusotm brand colors. You can hard code them if you want, but this is not a best practive. We can define a custom brand color pallet so you can take advantage of Chakra UI's `colorScheme` properties.

```javascript:theme.js
const colors = {
    brand_one: {
        50: '#EAD9CD',
        100: '#E3CDBC',
        200: '#DCC0AC',
        300: '#D5B39B',
        400: '#CEA78B',
        500: '#C89B7B',
        600: '#BB855E',
        700: '#AA7047',
        800: '#8E5E3B',
        900: '#714B2F'
    },
}

const overrides = {
    fonts,
    breakpoints,
    config,
    colors, // <-- pass in our colors
}
```

Now you can use these colors like such:

```javascript
<Button colorScheme="brand_one">I am a custom brand button!</Button>

or

<Text color="brand_one.500">I am a custom brand text!</Text>
```

You can also override the Chakra UI default colors. For example, if you don't like `red.500` as `#E53E3E` you can override it.

```javascript:theme.js
const colors = {
    red: {
        500: '#fff', // <-- setting red.500 to white!
    },
}
```
