## Introduction

As a developer, I find myself using the terminal all the time. In this article, I'll list the top 10 commands I use the most for speed and productivity, along with some examples.

<Step number="1" title="ls" />

The `ls` command is used to list the contents of a directory. It is a very basic command but it is a lot quicker than using the Finder to list the contents of a directory.

<Step number="2" title="cd" />

Next we'll look at the `cd` command. This command is used to change the current working directory. Again, it is a very basic command but it is a lot quicker than using the Finder to change the current working directory.

<Step number="3" title="pwd" />

`pwd` is used to print the current working directory. This command is very useful when you want to know where you are in a directory structure.

<Step number="4" title="cat" />

Getting into the more advanced commands is the `cat` command. This command is used to read the contents of a file without opening it. Here is an example:

```bash
cat README.md
```

Output:
```bash
# This is a markdown file
```

In this example, we are assuming that `README.md` has the contents `# This is a markdown file`.

<Step number="5" title="head" />

The `head` command is used to print the first few lines of a file. Here is an example:

```bash
head README.md
```

<Step number="6" title="tail" />

Similarly to `head`, the `tail` command is used to print the last few lines of a file. Here is an example:

```bash
tail README.md
```

<Step number="7" title="grep" />

Next is the `grep` command. This command is used to search for a pattern in a file. Here is an example:

```bash
grep -i "markdown" README.md
```

### Explanation

In this example, we are searching for the word `markdown` in the file `README.md`. We are also searching for the word `markdown` ignoring case, which is the `-i` flag.

<Step number="8" title="mkdir" />

The `mkdir` command is used to create a new directory. Here is an example:

```bash
mkdir new-directory
```

<Step number="9" title="touch" />

The `touch` command is used to create a new file. Here is an example:

```bash
touch newfile.txt
```

<Step number="10" title="rm" />

The last command is the `rm` command. This command is used to delete a file or directory. Here is an example:

```bash
rm newfile.txt
```

## Bonus 11th Tip!

As a bonus, you can use the `&&` operator to run multiple commands in one line. Here is an example:

```bash
mkdir new-directory && cd new-directory && touch newfile.txt
```

You can see we can make a new folder, change to the new folder, and create a new file all in one line!

## Conclusion

That's it for this article! I hope you find this article useful and that you can use it to speed up your development process. Here is a lsit of all the mac terminal commands we went over:
