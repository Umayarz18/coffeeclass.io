## What Are React Hooks?

Released in React 16.8, [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) allow you to you use state and other React features without writing a class.

Here is a simple example from the reactjs.org website:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'; // <--- import the hook

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // <--- useState is the hook

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As you can see, we can create a state variable named count in *only* one line using the `useState` hook.

> **Note:** React hooks are imported from React like such: `import { yourHookHere } from 'react'`.

## Using useEffect In Next.JS

Adding the `useEffect()` (or [Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)) hook in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is not at bad as one would think. Let's take a look at an example. We will use ```useEffect``` to add an event listener
to handle when a user scrolls. We will then log to the console the scrollY value. This is how this website dynamically adds
the css to the nav bar on scroll!

> The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in function components.

<Step number="1" title="Import useEffect from react" />

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
```

<Step number="2" title="Call the method and add code" />

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
        
    })
```

We can add anything we want in here. Let's add our event listeners:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
        window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
        return () => {
            window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll)
        }
    })
```

Finally, create the handle scroll method and log the scrollY value to the console:

```javascript
const handleScroll = () => {
        console.log(scrollY)
    }
```
