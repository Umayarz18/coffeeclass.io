## Introduction

If you have worked with Next.js, you have without a doubt come across the `next/image` component. Introduced in `v10.0.0`, `next/image` is an imporovement over the humble `<img />` HTML tag.

Features of `next/image` include:

- Image lazy loading
- A custom loader
- Quality control
- Placeholder image
- and more!

The `NextImage` component makes the lives of the website visiter much better, however, at times it can be hard to work with and make the lives of the developer harder!

## next/image Not Filling Parent Div

One of the most common issues with `next/image` is that it doesn't fill the parent div. Let's take a look at the following example:

```javascript
import NextImage from 'next/image'

<div height="500px" width="500px">
    <NextImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/1/500/500" layout="fill" />
</div>
```

Note: The code above is "pseudo code". It will not run. `height` and `width` cannot be declared on `div` like I did in the example above.

If I aked you what would happen, you would probably say that the image would render with a height of 500px and a width of 500px. However, this is not the case! The image will have the height and width of itself! If the raw image is 230px by 570px, those will be the dimensions.

## The Solution

I have seen this question asked many times on sites like stackoverflow. Some of the answers aren't even helpful!

- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/18739
- https://dev.to/tanahmed/next-image-make-image-fill-available-space-272o

The simple solution is to add `position: relative` to the parent div!

```javascript
import NextImage from 'next/image'

<div height="500px" width="500px" position="relative">
    <NextImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/1/500/500" layout="fill" />
</div>
```

Now, the image will take up the width of the parent div!

## Explanation

So why does this work? The default position of a html div tag is [`static`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16316834/what-is-the-default-value-of-position-attribute-of-a-div).

Because of this, the image will not fill the parent div.
