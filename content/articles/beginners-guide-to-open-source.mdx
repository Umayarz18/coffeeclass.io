## Introduction

**Open source software** (OSS) is intimidating to get involved with as new 
developers but so rewarding once we do. Beginners have a hard time getting 
started because projects are complex with problems and code structure that can 
be difficult to understand let alone add to. It feels difficult to find ways to 
contribute when you're new or have less experience with large codebases. Despite 
being new, there are still many ways to get active in open source. Being active 
in open source is great for developers to engage with the developer community 
and set themselves apart from other candidates in the job search. In this 
article, you'll learn the basics about open source software to start 
contributing today. 

## Prerequisites

Open source software is run by git versioning systems to allow multiple 
developers to work on the same code (think cooler Google Docs). OSS is often 
hosted via git hosting services like [GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E). 
This article goes over the barebones about open source benefits and methods to 
contribute. If you are unfamiliar with git, markdown, or GitHub, you will need 
to spend time learning those before you can contribute to open source effectively. 
I recommend either taking GitHub Learning Lab's [Introduction to GitHub course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) 
or following their [First Day on GitHub learning track](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-day-on-github) 
depending on how new you are to programming. There are many resources to learn 
about these subjects, so select a learning resource that fits you. You can still
enjoy the information of this article, but you will need knowledge of git to 
start contributing to an open source codebase.

## What is Open Source?

**Open source software** is any software that allows the public to edit, modify,
and improve on the codebase. These projects range from large codebases 
maintained by hundreds of developers to small side projects with only 
one developer. Each of these projects is made possible by developers that 
contribute via improving code quality, bug fixes, performance, documentation, 
and community awareness. 

### Open Source Licensing

Projects that are open sourced use different licenses to denote the level of 
freedom and restrictions a user of the code inherits. Licenses are a legal 
contract between the user and author of the code for what a user can and cannot 
do with the technology. There are many types open source licenses such as MIT or
GNU General Public License that place different rules on a project. It is always
important to know what type of license the project falls under so you are aware 
of your rights as a developer or user of the source code. (Note: you can learn 
more about [open source licenses in this article](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/resources/blog/open-source-licenses-explained/))

### Stakeholders of Open Source

There are several types of people involved in open source that help make it 
possible. Each person is responsible for the open source project in different 
ways:

- **Author:** Whoever created the repository. This can be an individual 
developer or an organization.

- **Owner:** Whoever has administrative access to the repository.

- **Maintainers:** Contributors that drive the repository's goals by assessing 
discussions, pull requests, and issues.

- **Contributors:** People that help add value to a project through coding and 
non-coding methods.

- **Community Members:** People that actively use the project and give feedback 
to the project.

With these varying roles,  developers can be wearing many hats. Sometimes 
maintainers are also the author or owners of the project. Contributors and 
community members get a say about a project's direction through being active 
and placing feature requests. The possible tasks and goals overlap between 
roles, allowing every contributor to feel the value of their work. 

## Benefits of Open Source contributions

Contributing to open source adds value to every stakeholder invested in a 
project. Organizations, developers, and the customers they serve all benefit 
from an active open source project.  This section will go more into the 
benefits for us as developers rather than the other stakeholders. As you 
experience open source contributions and become more active in the community, 
the benefits of your work become clear for the other stakeholders. If you like 
to know more about the business case, Tobe Langel does an excellent job stating 
[the benefits of businesses contributing to open source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XleabBLC4Q8).

### Better Source Code

Through contributing to open source, a project's quality improves. Contributions
can come from new or seasoned developers alike, all pooling in their experience 
and expertise to help strengthen a project. This collective skill goes on to 
cultivate best practices, list examples of project use cases, generate ideas for
new features or enhancements of existing ones. Improving these areas give 
stakeholders added value to use that open source project.

### Learn Best Practices

A beginner will pick up new coding skills by viewing and contributing to open 
source projects. With early software knowledge, simply reading the code brings 
awareness to industry standards that beginners can learn. With large projects, 
there is often a strong structure fueled with documentation, testing, and 
high-quality code. New developers may not understand it all at first, but as 
they grow their skills, the complexities of open source code become easier to 
digest. Developers can see examples of good coding techniques in projects and 
start implementing them in their work. This gives them a better idea of code 
etiquette and standards that help transform them into more knowledgeable 
developers.

### Connect with Community 

Like many things, the developer journey is better together. Being part of an 
open source community offers the chance to grow, network, and mentor/be 
mentored. You're essentially building connections with like-minded developers as
invested in the project as you are. This can stem opportunities to exchange 
knowledge and receive insights about your developer skills. It's also rewarding 
to just build bridges with developers of all walks of life that can be your 
support network throughout your tech journey. The community you engage with can 
keep you on track to reach your goals and help inspire you as well.

### Build Your Reputation

The job hunt is fierce for new developers and open source contributions provide 
a public track record of your ability as a developer. Your ability as an 
employable developer is shown not only through the code skills, but also your 
soft skills. Working on open source is like being part of a giant team. You 
tackle pain points experienced by community members and developers alike. You 
modify code using the proper procedures and gain experience working with large 
codebases. Even if your contributions seem small, they demonstrate your ability 
to work and communicate on a team. If you built connections in the community, 
that also builds your credibility as a developer and can bring opportunities 
straight to you. Putting yourself out there in open source allows you to show 
all the skills necessary to an employer that you're the right candidate.
