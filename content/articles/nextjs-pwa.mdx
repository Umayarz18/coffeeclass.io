## What's A Progressive Web App?

Imagine this... you have a website that is complex. It has a frontend, backend, data, and lots of other features.

You want to make an app for your website. Traditionally, you would have to make 2 apps - one for Android and one for IOS. Another more modern option would be to use a cross platform framework such as Flutter or React Native. This still involves a lot of work!

There has to be another way. Luckily for us, there is (kind of). A Progressive Web App, or PWA, is a website that looks and behaves like a mobile app. PWA's even have splash screens!

The user also doesn't have to download your app from the app or play store and your app is always updated whenvever you update your website.

## PWA Demo

[Here](https://next-pwa-rosy.vercel.app) is a simple site I deployed with the `next-pwa` package. If you open it in Google Chrome or on your phone, you will see a button that says "Install App".

## `next-pwa` Package

Creating a PWA can be difficult. However, with Next.js we can easily create one using the [`next-pwa` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-pwa). Under the hook this package uses [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/). Here are some of the features you get from using `next-pwa`:

### Features

- 0️⃣ Zero config for registering and generating service worker
- ✨ Optimized precache and runtime cache
- 💯 Maximize lighthouse score
- 🎈 Easy to understand examples
- 📴 Completely offline support with fallbacks example 🆕
- 📦 Use workbox and workbox-window v6
- 🍪 Work with cookies out of the box
- 🔉 Default range requests for audios and videos
- ☕ No custom server needed for Next.js 9+ example
- 🔧 Handle PWA lifecycle events opt-in example
- 📐 Custom worker to run extra code with code splitting and typescript support example
- 📜 Public environment variables available in custom worker as usual
- 🐞 Debug service worker with confidence in development mode without caching
- 🌏 Internationalization (a.k.a I18N) with next-i18next example
- 🛠 Configurable by the same workbox configuration options for GenerateSW and InjectManifest
- 🚀 Spin up a GitPod and try out examples in rocket speed
- ⚡ Support blitz.js (simply add to blitz.config.js)
- 🔩 (Experimental) precaching .module.js when next.config.js has experimental.modern set to true

## `next-pwa` Installation

First, Add the `next-pwa` package. I'll be using `yarn`.

```bash
yarn add next-pwa
```

## `manifest.json`

We need to create a `manifest.json` file to tell `next-pwa` some basic info about our app. We can use [this website](https://www.simicart.com/manifest-generator.html/) to help us out.

Go ahead and fill out all the fields that are required and the optional fiels if you'd like. For the display option, be sure to select standalone.

When you are done, download it and move all the files into your `public` folder. Rename the `manifest.webmanifest` file to `manifest.json`.

## `_document.js`

Add the following code to `_document.js` inside of the `Head` tag. If you don't have this file, create it.

```javascript:_document.js
<Head>
  <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
  <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icon.png"></link>
  {/* other stuff here */}
</Head>
```

## `next.config.js`

Add the following to `next.config.js`:

```javascript:next.config.js
const withPWA = require("next-pwa");

module.exports = withPWA({
  pwa: {
    dest: "public",
    register: true,
    skipWaiting: true,
    disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
  },
});
```

These options set up the `next-pwa` package to work with our project. If you run yarn dev with the `disable` option commented out, you will see some generated files inside of the `public` folder. We don't need these in dev so that is the reason we have added that line.

Going one step further, we can add the following to `.gitignore` so the PWA files will not be tracked by git.

```javascript:.gitignore
# PWA files
**/public/sw.js
**/public/workbox-*.js
**/public/worker-*.js
**/public/sw.js.map
**/public/workbox-*.js.map
**/public/worker-*.js.map
```

## Deploying

Go ahead and deploy your website. Then navigate to chrome and at the top you should see a button to install the PWA.

## Conclusion

Congrats! You have just created a Progressive Web App!

To recap, in this article we:

- Added the `next-pwa` package
- Added the `manifest.json` file
- Added the `_document.js` file
- Added the `next.config.js` file
- Added the `.gitignore` file
- Deployed the website
