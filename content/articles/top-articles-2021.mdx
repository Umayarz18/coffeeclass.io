<Step number="1" title="How To Use The map() Function In Dart" />

This brings us to our most popular post of 2021, "How To Use The map() Function In Dart". The idea for this article came to me when I ran into an issue in one of my Flutter projects so I decided to write about it. Aparently many other ran into the same issue as well. The article goes over how to use the `map` function in dart and compares it to the `map` function in JavaScript.
