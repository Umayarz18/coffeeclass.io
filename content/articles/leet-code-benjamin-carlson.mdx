## 2114. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences

[Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-found-in-sentences/) on Leetcode.

### Question

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence. Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

### Solutions

#### JavaScript

```javascript
var mostWordsFound = function(sentences) {
    let maxCount = sentences[0].split(" ").length
    
    // loop over each sentence
    for (let i = 1; i < sentences.length; i++) {
        let tempCount = sentences[i].split(" ").length
        if (tempCount > maxCount)
            maxCount = tempCount
    }
    
    return maxCount
};
```


#### C#

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MostWordsFound(string[] sentences) {
        int maxCount = sentences[0].Split(" ").Length;
            
        foreach(string sentence in sentences.Skip(1)) {
            int tempCount = sentence.Split(" ").Length;
            if (tempCount > maxCount)
                maxCount = tempCount;
        }
        
        return maxCount;
    }
}
```

#### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        int total = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; sentences.length > i; i++){
            int tempLength = sentences[i].split(" ").length;
            if(tempLength > total){
                total = tempLength;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

We are asked to figure out which sentence has the most words. The sentences are held in an array. The idea is to iterate over each of the sentences and count the number of words. Each word is seperated by a space. An easy way to get this count is to use `split()`. After we split by spaces, we can use `length` to get the count.

Each time we get the count, we should compare it to our previous count. Take the higher count. Initially, we will set the `maxCount` to the first sentence. We can get this value like such: 

```javascript
let maxCount = sentences[0].split(" ").length
```

Then, we start our for loop at `i = 1`.

### Runtime

The runtime for this problem would be `O(n)` where n is the number of sentences.
