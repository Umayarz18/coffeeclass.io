## Introduction

Algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science. They are used to solve problems, and they are the foundation of everything we do. In this course you will learn how to implement and analyze algorithms using Big O.

## Level

<p>
  This course is at the intermediate level. You should be familiar with at least
  one language, preferably an{" "}
  <DefinitionPopup title="object oriented language.">
    Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.
  </DefinitionPopup>{" "}
  Some of the examples will cover a variety of languages while others will only use one. Each example at the very least will include Java exmaples.
