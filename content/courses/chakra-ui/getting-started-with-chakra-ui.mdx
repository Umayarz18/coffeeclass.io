## Installing Chakra UI

To install Chakra UI on your website (regardless of the framework), you will need to add the packages either viaÂ [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)Â orÂ [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Navigate to the root of your project.

### Installing Chakra UI Via Yarn

```bash
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4
```

### Installing Chakra UI Via NPM

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^4
```

We are also installingÂ `@emotion/react`,Â `@emotion/styled`Â andÂ `framer-motion` because Chakra UI depends upon them.

## Chakra Provider

Now that we have the packages installed, we need to wrap our app with ChakraProvider. Please follow along with your framework below as each one is different.

### React And ChakraProvider

1. Navigate to the root of your react app.
2. Add the following code:
    
    ```bash
    import * as React from "react";
    
    // 1. import `ChakraProvider` component
    import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    
    function App({ Component }) {
      // 2. Use at the root of your app
      return (
        <ChakraProvider>
          <Component />
        </ChakraProvider>
      );
    }
    ```
    

### Next.js And ChakraProvider

1. Open `_app.js`
2. Add the following code:
    
    ```bash
    import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react"
    
    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
      return (
        <ChakraProvider>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ChakraProvider>
      )
    }
    export default MyApp
    ```
    

### Gatsby And ChakraProvider

1. Add the `@chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin`

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin

...... or ......

yarn add @chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin
```

ðŸŽ‰ Chakra UI is now ready to use! ðŸŽ‰

## Optional Packages

There are 2 optional packages you can install.

### Chakra Icons

Chakra UI does have its own icon pack! Although it is small, it offers some common icons that look minimalistic. To use these icons we must install the icons.

```bash
yarn add @chakra-ui/icons

// or

npm i @chakra-ui/icons
```

### Theme Tools

This package is meant to make it easier for you to customize components or build your own design system. This is an advanced feature and in most cases is not necessary. However, if you are so inclined, you can add the package, again via yarn or npm.

```bash
yarn add @chakra-ui/theme-tools

// or

npm i @chakra-ui/theme-tools
```

## Using Chakra UI With TypeScript

According to the Chakra UI docs, when using TypeScript a minimum TypeScript version of `4.1.0` is required.
