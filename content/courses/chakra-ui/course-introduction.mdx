## Introduction

Building a user interface is hard. A great option to rapidly build a UI is to use a component library. If you are using React, or a React based framework, you can use [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) to build your UI. In this course, we'll learn Chakra UI. We'll start with the basics, and then we'll move on to more advanced topics.

This course is at the beginner level. If you are familiar with React and the concept of CSS frameworks, you should be able to follow along.
