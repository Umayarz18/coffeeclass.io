## Introduction

**A stack is defined as a collection of objects that are inserted and removed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner.** You can only add (push) and remove (pop) objects from the top of the stack.

Think of Google Chrome. When you visit a page, that page is pushed onto a stack. When you visit another page, that new page is pushed onto the stack. To find the current page, you look at the top element of the stack. To find the previous page, you pop the top element off the stack. If you visit 10 pages and want to find the first page, you would have to pop every element until you find the first page.

A stack is an <DefinitionPopup title="abstract data type.">An abstract data type (ADT) is a type who's behavior is defined by a set of values and operations.</DefinitionPopup> It supports 2 operations: push and pop. Stacks also support the following accessor operations: top, size, and isEmpty.

## Array Based Stack

We can use an array to implement a stack. The first element, array[0], will be the first element in.

### Java

```java
public class ArrayStack<E> implements Stack<E> {

}
```

The array based stack is simple and easy to implement. One drawback is that it has a fixed size.
