When you were first learning `html`, you had to learn all the different tags. There are `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<pre>`, and many more. For most of these tags chakra ui has a corresponding component. On this page we will go over some common ones. Refer to the [chakra ui docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) for a complete list.

Before we begin, to use any of these components, simply import them from `@chakra-ui/react`:

```javascript
import {
    someChakraUIComponent,
} from '@chakra-ui/react'
```

## Layout Components

Layout components are essential for any webpage. Chakra UI gives us a large number of layout components. We will cover 5 of them here. 

### Box

From the Chakra UI website:

> [Box](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/layout/box) is the most abstract component on top of which all other Chakra UI components are built. By default, it renders a div element.

Essentially, it is a `<div>` element that allows us to pass in shorthand styles as props.

#### Import

```javascript
import { Box } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

#### Usage

```javascript
<Box bg="tomato" w="100%" p={4} color="white">
  This is the Box
</Box>
```

### Flex

## Form Components

## Data Display Components

## Overlay Components

These are only some of the many components Chakra UI offers us.

## Using Chakra UI Components

To use Chakra UI, simple import the components you want to use and use them just like any other `html` tag.

Inside of your website, open `index.js` and add the following code:

Let's take a look at each of the tags we used.

### Flex

The flex tag renders as a `div` tag with the `display: flex` property.

```javascript
<div style={{ display: "flex" }}></div>
```

is equal to

```javascript
<Flex></Flex>
```

On top of this, we have shorthand properties for common flex properties. See the table below for some of them.

| CSS Flex Property | React Shorthand | Chakra UI Shorthand |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| flex-direction    | flexDirection   | direction           |
| flex-wrap         | flexWrap        | wrap                |
| align-items       | alignItems      | align               |

The leftmost column is the standard `css` property. The middle column is the `react` shorthand. And the rightmost colum is the `chakra ui` shorthand.

We have this kind of shorthard for almost every css property. `margin` is `m`, `width` is `w`, `maxWidth` is `maxW`, and so on.

### Heading

### Text

### Button

In the next module we will take a look at more common Chakra UI components.
