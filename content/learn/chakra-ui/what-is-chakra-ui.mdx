## Chakra UI Introduction

Chakra UI is a CSS framework for React based applications (React, Next.js, and Gatsby) which allows you to create accessible React apps with speed.

> Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.

## Chakra VS

You may have heard of other CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or TailwindCSS. While there are some similarities between Chakra UI and these other frameworks, there are also distinct differences.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a CSS Framework that provides atomic CSS classes to help you style components. Tailwind CSS handles responsive styles, dark mode, etc using pseudo-classes.

```html
<p w-16 md:w-32 bg-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-100 hover:dark:bg-gray-200>I am text</p>
```

A downside to TailwindCSS is that it is up to you, the developer, to handle semantic html, WAI-ARIA requirements, keyboard navigation, and more.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap (rather React-Bootstrap) is an open source toolkit to quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap. Bootstrap is. widely considered the industry standard for CSS Frameworks.

### Material UI

Material UI is a set of React components for faster and easier web development. It is a comprehensive guide for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices.

### Theme UI

Chakra UI was heavily inspired by Theme UI and follows the system UI specifications. With that said, Chakra UI provides more components, improved styling API, accessibility, and intuitive component APIs than Theme UI.

## Chakra UI Pros

Now that you know a little bit about some Chakra UI alternatives, let's dive into some pros of Chakra UI.

### Accessable

Chakra UI strictly follows WAI-ARIA standards for all components.

### Themeable

We can easily customize any part of the Chakra UI components to match our design needs. We dive deep into this in the Customize Them module.

### Composable

Components compose other components under the hood and Chakra UI allows you to do the same.

### Light and Dark UI

Optimized for multiple color modes out of the box!
