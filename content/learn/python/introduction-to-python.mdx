Python is an [interpreted](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#:~:text=Object%2Doriented%20programming%20(OOP),(often%20known%20as%20methods).), [high level programming language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-high-level-and-low-level-languages/). It 
was created in 1991 by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum). Compared to languages like Java or C,
Python is much easier to learn and master making it a good first language to learn. For a slightly longer executive summary, check
out the [Python docs](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/).

We can do so much with Python. Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, even Mobile App Development - Python really
does do it all.

In this series, we will start with the basics of Python Programming and work our way to intermediate and advanced features. If you
are looking for Python projects, you may want to visit the [tutorial](/tutorials) or [snippet](/snippets) sections of this website.
