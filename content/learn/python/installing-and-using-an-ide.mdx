Before we can write any Python code, we need to install it. Navigate to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
download the correct version for your machine. Make sure you are downloading Python 3.9.x. Once you have this, you should be able to run
the command `python` in your terminal (mac) or command prompt (windows). Try running the statement: 

```python
print('hello, world!')
``` 

You should see something like this:

Congratulations! You just wrote your first line of Python code!

When we write code with Python, we probably dont want to be using the terminal. We can install an IDE or Integrated Development Environment
that will speed up our development time. Python's default IDE is [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html). It is not that good so we will not be using it. Instead, 
we will be installing VSCode. Navigate to [code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download the correct version for your machine.

When it finishes installing, open it. A new unnamed file will automatically be created. If you type <KeyboardKey>command</KeyboardKey> + <KeyboardKey>s</KeyboardKey>, you can save your file.
Use the `.py` extension to tell your machine that this is Python code. For example: `my_file.py`. In the next section we will start writing code!
